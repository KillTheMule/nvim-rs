## Contributing

I'd love contributions, comments, praise, criticism... You could open an
[issue](https://github.com/KillTheMule/nvim-rs/issues) or a [pull
request](https://github.com/KillTheMule/nvim-rs/pulls). I also read the
subreddits for [rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/) and
[neovim](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/), if that suits you better.
